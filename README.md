## 🔹 About Me

I like building things that connect **research and real-world systems** — from visual SLAM on drones to network system.

- Experience with **visual SLAM–based AR drone systems** using Intel RealSense T265 + NVIDIA Jetson (Ubuntu, C++/CMake).  
- Built **NLP pipelines** in R/Python using transformer models (BERT/RoBERTa) on environmental policy text.  
- Developed **ML-backed web applications** (Flask) for prediction and data-driven decision-making.  
- Strong foundations in **algorithms, data structures, systems, and computer architecture**.
